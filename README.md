A simple script utility for quickly downloading, starting, and monitoring your dedicated RUST game server.

This tool streamlines the process of getting a RUST server up and running, managing dependencies like SteamCMD, and providing basic operational oversight.



This code allow you to:

One-Click Setup: Automatically downloads SteamCMD and the latest dedicated RUST server files.

Easy Launch: Starts the RUST server and clearly displays the IP address and port for connection.

Status Check: Provides an immediate status of the server process, verifies if the configured port is open, and shows the last 40 lines of the server log file for quick diagnostics.



To use this:

Open this file in Google Colab

Press 1st button and wait till it will download all files and finishes work

Edit 2nd code to your server name and max players (dont set too much, else your server will crash when many players on server)

(You can not be able to connect to this server because Google may not allow connections to their servers.)
